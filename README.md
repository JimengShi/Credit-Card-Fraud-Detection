# Credit-Card-Fraud-Detection
Based on the data of credit card transaction records, a classification model is built to predict which transaction records are abnormal and which are normal.

## Task Flow
- Load the data and observe the problem
- Provide solutions to problems
- Build logistic regression model
- Compare evaluation methods
- Analyze modeling results
- Adjust logistic regression model
- Scheme effect comparison
